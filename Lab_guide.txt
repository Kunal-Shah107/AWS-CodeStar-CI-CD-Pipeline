Project Overview

In this lab, we will create a Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery pipeline using AWS, and then use that pipeline to deploy a new version of our website automatically. We'll implement this with AWS CodeStar, a frontend tool that will automatically configure AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodeDeploy, and AWS CodePipeline. By the end of the lab, you should understand what a CI/CD pipeline is, as well as the basics of how to set one up and push an update to a source code repository to trigger a new deploy.

Solution

- Log in to the live AWS environment.
- Make sure you're in the same region throughout the lab.

Create a CI/CD Pipeline

- Navigate to CodeStar --> Click Create project.
- If the Create service role dialog appears, click Create service role.
- Click the HTML card.
- Click Services and open EC2 in a new tab.
- Click KeyPairs located in the navigation menu.
- Click Create key pair.
- For Name, enter pipeline.
- Click Create key pair.
- Back in the CodeStar browser tab, close the key pair dialog.
- Click Next.
- For Project name, enter Pipeline.
- For the repository, select AWS CodeCommit.
- For the Instance type, select t2.micro.
- Choose the Subnet for us-east-1a.
- Choose the pipeline and click ** Next**.
- Click Create Project. It could take 5-10 minutes for the project to finish being set up.
- Deploy a New Version of a Website using a CI/CD Pipeline
- Click View application to navigate to our web application.
- Back in the CodeStar browser tab, click IDE.
- Click Access your project code.
- Click Edit in AWS CodeCommit. This opens our repositories.
- Click the webpage folder.
- Click the index.html file. This is the code used to generate the website we just visited.
- Click Edit.
- Scroll down to line 61.
- Change the h1 header in line 61 to:
- acloudguy.in (You can keep anything)
- Change the h2 header in line 62 to:
- You just deployed using your own CI/CD pipeline! (You can keep anything)
- In the Commit changes to master section, set the following values:
- Author name: Your name
- Email address: test@test.com
- Commit message: Update the website.
- Click Commit changes.
- In the CodeStar browser tab, click Pipeline to watch it all be deployed.
- Refresh the web app we visited before, where we should see our new message we just edited in the code.

- Conclusion
- Congratulations on successfully completing this hands-on lab!
